        <p>
          I'm a research and engineering leader at
          <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-light transition-colors">Stanford University</a>,
          where I lead technical development of
          <a href="https://roar.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-light transition-colors">ROAR</a>
          — a web-based reading assessment platform used by researchers and schools at scale.
          I built and manage the engineering team, the assessment delivery infrastructure,
          and the data/analytics pipelines that power the research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Stanford, I was a data science postdoc at the
          <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-light transition-colors">UW eScience Institute</a>,
          where I built open-source tools for reproducible neuroimaging analysis —
          including pyAFQ (published in Nature Methods) and Cloudknot (serverless batch computing on AWS).
        </p>
        <p>
          My PhD is in computational nuclear physics from the University of Washington,
          where I developed high-performance Monte Carlo simulations on DOE supercomputers
          as a
          <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-light transition-colors">Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>.
          The work resulted in a Physical Review Letters publication and gave me deep
          expertise in statistical methods, large-scale computing, and building software
          that has to be correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before grad school, I served as a
          <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-light transition-colors">U.S. Peace Corps</a>
          health education volunteer in Morocco, where I led community health infrastructure projects
          and co-organized the country's first national English spelling bee.
          Before that, I was an Air Force officer and systems engineer at the
          <a href="https://www.losangeles.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/343702/space-and-missile-systems-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-light transition-colors">Space and Missile Systems Center</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I care about building things that are rigorous enough for science and practical enough
          for real-world deployment. I contribute to open-source scientific software and believe
          in reproducible, transparent research.
