    <h3>Neuroscience</h3>
<p>My current research interests lie at the nexus of neuroimaging and
data science. I focus on developing statistical techniques and
software for the analysis of diffusion <span class="caps">MRI</span> (dMRI) data, which is situated
within the paradigm of Automated Fiber Quantification (<span class="caps">AFQ</span>). See
<a href="autofq.org"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">autofq.org</a>
for further documentation of our projects. I am
supervised by 
<a href="arokem.org"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Rokem</a>
and collaborate with
<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Noah Simon</a>,
<a href="https://www.brainandeducation.com/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Yeatman</a>, and
<a href="https://anisha.pizza/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Anisha Keshavan</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p>
<h3>Physics</h3>
<p>Before transitioning to neuroscience, I pursued
physics, earning my PhD under the supervision of
<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/bulgac/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Aurel Bulgac</a>
at the University of Washington. My research focused on sign-problem
avoidance techniques in auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
with applications to the <span class="caps">BCS</span>-<span class="caps">BEC</span> crossover and infinite neutron matter.
I was fortunate to collaborate with
<a href="https://users.physics.unc.edu/~drut/public_html_UNC/index.html"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Joaqu&iacute;n Drut</a>,
<a href="http://www.quantumnovae.com/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Holt</a>,
<a href="http://users.nccs.gov/~roche/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Roche</a>, and
<a href="http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~gabrielw/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabriel Wlaz&#0322;owski</a>. </p>
<p>Before that, I earned my <span class="caps">MS</span> in physics under the supervision of
<a href="https://web.csulb.edu/depts/physics/people/bill_a.shtml"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Andreas Bill</a> at 
<a href="https://www.csulb.edu/physics-astronomy"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">California State University, Long Beach</a>.
My research there focused on modeling the coexistence of
superconductivity and magnetism in heterogeneous structures composed of
superconducting and ferromagnetic&nbsp;layers.</p>
<p>I was a visiting researcher for about six months at <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s
<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>.
Under the supervision of
<a href="https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/people/j_armstrong"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">John Armstrong</a>,
we demonstrated a new radio science application for spacecraft
navigation signals.
<!---
Guidance engineers use the Doppler shift of these signals to
verify spacecraft trajectory. We realized that the uplink and downlink
irregularities — what guidance engineers would call “noise” —
held information about the near-Sun plasma environment. We exploited
the differing transfer functions of these irregularities to localize
solar plasma scattering along the line-of-sight, proving a new method to
monitor solar activity. Using Cassini spacecraft data, we demonstrated
that this technique could determine scattering position to spatial
scales well below that of other techniques.

<h3>Computing</h3>
<p>Computational science is the theme uniting my work in both physics and
neuroscience. Here are some of my research computing activities not
captured in the domain-specific sections&nbsp;above:</p>
<h5>The&nbsp;Carpentries</h5>
<p>I volunteer as an instructor with
<a href="https://carpentries.org/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">The Carpentries</a>
(which comprises
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Carpentry</a>
and
<a href="https://datacarpentry.org/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Carpentry</a>).
I help teach shell scripting, introductory python, and principles of
version control in 2-4 day workshops hosted by the eScience Institute at
the University of&nbsp;Washington.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn basic lab skills for research computing, you
should definitely attend one of the upcoming
<a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">carpentries workshops</a>
or contact me if you&#8217;d like help in requesting a workshop at your&nbsp;institution.</p>
<h5>Cloudknot</h5>
<p>With 
<a href="arokem.org"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Rokem</a>,
we developed a python library
called Cloudknot
(<a href="https://nrdg.github.io/cloudknot/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/nrdg/cloudknot"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>)
that helps researchers run eir existing code on
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="caps">AWS</span> Batch</a>.</p>
<h5><span class="caps">UW</span> Research Computing&nbsp;Club</h5>
<p>As my PhD research became more and more computationally
intensive, I helped start the
<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="caps">UW</span> Research Computing Club</a>.
I served as a founding officer and the president of the club, which
facilitates access to and training for <span class="caps">UW</span>’s shared supercomputing
cluster, Hyak. The club manages over one million dollars in computing
resources, both on Hyak and in the cloud. It provides access to
these resources and training to students to use them effectively and
responsibly. To my knowledge, it is the only student-run club in
the nation that provides access to supercomputing resources to all
undergraduate and graduate students on its campus, regardless of lab
affiliation. After serving as president of the club, I then served on
the
<a href="http://www.int.washington.edu/users/mjs5/HYAK/governance/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyak Governance Board</a>,
which advises the leadership of <span class="caps">UW</span> on how best to meet the high
performance computing needs of <span class="caps">UW</span>&nbsp;researchers.</p>
